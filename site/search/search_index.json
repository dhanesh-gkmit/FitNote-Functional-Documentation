It provides a digital solution for tracking workouts and diet plans for both fitness mentors who train their clients and for the clients themselves who are taking metorship. Need of the Project Fitness mentors currently have to track all their clients\u2019 workout schedules manually , either in notebooks or in note-taking apps. Mentors have to send workout plans to clients through WhatsApp or other communication channels , which becomes messy and unorganized. For client\u2019s workout data, mentors often rely on video meetings or calls , which is time-consuming and inefficient. Gym trainees also have to maintain their daily workouts manually in notebooks or random note-taking apps, which is not reliable. When trainees want to review their previous workouts, they have to search through old notes or chats , and if they haven\u2019t recorded them properly, they don\u2019t have any accurate history of past workouts. Objective The main objective of the platform is to provide a single place where: Fitness Mentor can assign workouts shedule's to clients can monitor progress by reviewing past workout data and daily performance reports Clients can can see the workouts assigned to them can track all their past workout schedules and progress.","title":"Requiremnts & Objective"},{"location":"#project-overview","text":"FitNote is a fitness tracking and management web application designed for gym goers and personal trainer.

Once both agree to start, the mentor creates a new account for the client by generating a unique username and password . These credentials are shared with the client, who can then log in to the system and access their personalized dashboard. If the client ever forgets their credentials, the mentor has full authority to reset or regenerate a new username and password for that same client. This setup ensures: - A controlled onboarding process (mentor-approved accounts only) - Secure access for each client - Easy recovery for lost credentials Trainer Functionalities: 1. Client Management Add new client with a username and password. Edit user details when needed (like usernname or password). View all client with full info \u2013 their profile, assigned workouts, and past workouts. Delete client if they stop mentorship. 2. Create, Assign & Manage Templates Templates are structured schedules for both workouts and diet plans. They help trainers maintain consistency, save time, and ensure every client follows a personalized plan suited to their goals. How it works When a new client joins who dont have knowladge about the the workout splits & diet, the trainer usually starts with a beginner-level template . As the client progresses or introduces new requirements (like muscle gain, fat loss, or injury recovery), the trainer can update or switch them to a different template \u2014 ensuring the plan always aligns with their fitness stage. Functionalities Create: Build workout or diet templates based on daily or monthly routines. Assign: Apply a template to one or multiple clients simultaneously. Edit: Modify exercises, meal items, or schedules whenever needed. Remove: Detach a specific client from a template without deleting the template itself. Delete: Remove outdated or unnecessary templates to keep the system clean. Training Templates: 1.Workout Template Used for: Both strength (resistance) and cardio sessions \u2014 allowing trainers to plan a complete workout routine in one place. Each workout day can include a mix of: - Strength exercises: These involve lifting weights and are used to build muscle. - Cardio exercises: These improve cardiovascular health, stamina, and endurance (e.g., running, cycling). Includes: - Exercise name - Type (e.g. Strength / Cardio) - Sets or duration where sets are for the strength exercises and duration is for the cardio exercises. - Suggested weight or intensity - Reps (for strength exercises) Example: Exercise Name Type Sets / Duration Suggested Weight / Intensity Reps Range Bench Press Strength 3 sets 20kg / 25kg / 30kg 10 / 8 / 6 Squats Strength 4 sets 40kg / 45kg / 50kg 12 / 10 / 8 Shoulder Press Strength 3 sets 15kg / 20kg / 25kg 10 / 10 / 8 Running Cardio 30 mins Moderate pace \u2014 Rope Skipping Cardio 3 \u00d7 30 sec High intensity \u2014 2.Diet Template Used for: Planning meals and timings. Includes: - Meal number - Food items with quantity - Message or time gap after the meal Example: Meal No. Food Items & Quantity Message / Gap After Meal Meal 1 Oats + Banana Wait 2 hrs before next meal Meal 2 Brown Rice + Chicken Light walk after meal Meal 3 Paneer + Salad Wait 3 hrs before next meal Meal 4 Oats + Milk No food after this meal 3. Report Handling 3. Report Handling Trainers get daily progress reports of the assigned schedule from clients via email. Trainers can also receive reports for past workout and cardio sessions of the client if the client forgot to send them or was not able to send them on time.","title":"Initial Workflow &Trainer Functionalities"},{"location":"trainer_functionalities/#initial-workflow","text":"Before using the application, the journey typically begins when a client approaches a mentor/trainer through social media, a phone call, or any other communication channel seeking fitness guidance.
