## Initial Workflow

Before using the application, the journey typically begins when a **client** approaches a **mentor/trainer** through social media, a phone call, or any other communication channel seeking fitness guidance.

Once both agree to start, the **mentor** creates a new account for the client by generating a **unique username and password**.  
These credentials are shared with the client, who can then **log in** to the system and access their personalized dashboard.

If the client ever forgets their credentials, the mentor has full authority to **reset** or **regenerate** a new username and password for that same client.

This setup ensures:
- A controlled onboarding process (mentor-approved accounts only)  
- Secure access for each client  
- Easy recovery for lost credentials

# Trainer Functionalities:

## 1. Client Management

- **Add new client** with a username and password.  
- **Edit user details** when needed (like usernname or password).  
- **View all client** with full info – their profile, assigned workouts, and past workouts.  
- **Delete client** if they stop mentorship.

## 2. Create, Assign & Manage Templates

Templates are **structured schedules** for both workouts and diet plans.  
They help trainers maintain consistency, save time, and ensure every client follows a personalized plan suited to their goals.

### How it works
When a new client joins who dont have knowladge about the the workout splits & diet, the trainer usually starts with a **beginner-level template**.  
As the client progresses or introduces new requirements (like muscle gain, fat loss, or injury recovery), the trainer can **update or switch** them to a different template — ensuring the plan always aligns with their fitness stage.

### Functionalities
- **Create:** Build workout or diet templates based on daily or monthly routines of client.  
- **Assign:** Apply a template to one or multiple clients simultaneously.  
- **Edit:** Modify exercises, meal items, or schedules whenever needed.  
- **Remove Client:** Detach a specific client from a template.  
- **Delete:** Remove unnecessary templates to keep the system clean.


#### Training Templates:
