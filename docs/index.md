## Project Overview

FitNote is a fitness tracking and management web application designed for gym goers and personal trainer.
It provides a digital solution for tracking workouts and diet plans for both fitness mentors who train their clients and for the clients themselves who are taking metorship.

## Problems

1. **Fitness mentors currently have to track all their clients’ workout schedules manually**, either in notebooks or in note-taking apps.

2. **Mentors have to send workout plans to clients through WhatsApp or other communication channels**, which becomes messy and unorganized.

3. **For client’s workout data, mentors often rely on video meetings or calls**, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

4. **Gym trainees also have to maintain their daily workouts manually** in notebooks or random note-taking apps, which is not reliable.

5. **When trainees want to review their previous workouts, they have to search through old notes or chats**, and if they haven’t recorded them properly, they don’t have any accurate history of past workouts.
