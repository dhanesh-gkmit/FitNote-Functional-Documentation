It provides a digital solution for tracking workouts and diet plans for both fitness mentors who train their clients and for the clients themselves who are taking mentorship. This application is designed for a single trainer managing multiple clients , providing a centralized system to organize, assign, the workout and diet schedules. Problems Statement Fitness mentors currently have to track all their clients\u2019 workout schedules manually , either in notebooks or in note-taking apps. Mentors have to send workout plans to clients through WhatsApp or other communication channels , which becomes messy and unorganized. For client\u2019s workout data, mentors often rely on video meetings or calls , which is time-consuming and inefficient. Gym trainees also have to maintain their daily workouts manually in notebooks or random note-taking apps, which is not reliable. When trainees want to review their previous workouts, they have to search through old notes or chats , and if they haven\u2019t recorded them properly, they don\u2019t have any accurate history of past workouts. Solution A single online platform where : Fitness Mentor can assign workouts schedule's to clients. can monitor progress by reviewing past workout data and daily performance reports Clients can see the workouts assigned to them. can track all their past workout schedules and progress.","title":"Requiremnts & Objective"},{"location":"#documentation","text":"","title":"\u2014 Documentation"},{"location":"#project-overview","text":"FitNote is a fitness tracking and management web application designed for gym-goers and personal trainer.

View and Follow Assigned Schedules Clients can view their complete weekly schedule, which includes workout and diet templates for each day assigned to them by their mentor. They just have to follow the schedule as mentioned in the template. 2. Save and Submit Workout Reports to Mentor Flow of the Process When the client fills out their daily report for each exercise, the following two fields are required: 1. Client\u2019s attained weight 2. Client\u2019s attained reps . After completing the inputs, the client can save the report in the database and then send it to the mentor for review.

Once both agree to start, the mentor creates a new account for the client by generating a unique username and password . These credentials are shared with the client, who can then log in to the system and access their personalized dashboard. If the client ever forgets their credentials, the mentor has full authority to verify and provide the login details again. This setup ensures: - A controlled onboarding process (mentor-approved accounts only) - Secure access for each client - Easy recovery for lost credentials Trainer Functionalities: 1. Client Management Add new client with a username and password. View all clients with full info \u2013 their profile, assigned workouts,login credentials and past workouts. Delete client if they stop mentorship. 2. Create, Assign & Manage Templates Templates are structured schedules for both workouts and diet plans. They help trainers maintain consistency, save time, and ensure every client follows a personalized plan suited to their goals. How it works When a new client joins without workout or diet knowledge, the trainer usually starts with a beginner-level template . As the client progresses or introduces new requirements (like muscle gain, fat loss, or injury recovery), the trainer can update or switch them to a different template \u2014 ensuring the plan always aligns with their fitness stage. Functionalities Create: Build workout or diet templates based on daily or monthly routines of client. Assign: Apply a template to one or multiple clients simultaneously. Edit: Modify exercises, meal items, or schedules whenever needed. Remove Client: Detach a specific client from a template. Delete: Remove unnecessary templates to keep the system clean. Training Templates: 1. Workout Template Used for: Strength exercises - Strength exercises: These involve lifting weights and are used to build muscle. Includes: - Exercise name - Number of Sets - Suggested weight - Reps Example: Exercise Name Sets / Duration Suggested Weight Reps Range Bench Press 3 sets 20kg / 25kg / 30kg 10 / 8 / 6 Squats 4 sets 40kg / 45kg / 50kg 12 / 10 / 8 Shoulder Press 3 sets 15kg / 20kg / 25kg 10 / 10 / 8 2. Diet Template Used for: Planning meals and timings. Includes: - Food item - Quantity - Time Example: Food Item Quantity Time Oats 1 Bowl 6:00 AM Banana 1 Piece 6:00 AM Brown Rice 1 Plate 9:00 AM Paneer 100g 12:30 PM Salad 1 Bowl 12:30 PM Oats 1 Bowl 7:00 PM Milk 1 Glass 7:00 PM 3. Report Handling Trainers get daily progress reports of the assigned schedule from clients via email.
